### 2025-05-13 - RFC Reading
Read up on [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) (TOTP) and [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226) (HOTP) which it is based on. Thought about how to split the team's work (will probably look into implementing the HMAC part myself so as to avoid this from being a trivial "follow the instructions/reference implementation" project - that part I'll leave for Victor).

### 2025-05-14 - AP Physics

Took and hopefully got a 5 on the AP Physics C examination
^ written by Victor in my stead (appreciated!), Mechanics today and E&M tomorrow...

### 2025-05-15 - AP Physics Again (not to be confused with AP Physics 2)
Will be out one more day for the E&M exam... asked Victor to take a look at the RFCs and think about what language he'll be using so we can integrate accordingly [might build my hashing part as a separate program to execute in lieu of good FFI], We Will See what happens... (this is being written during 2025-05-14)
