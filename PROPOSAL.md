# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

David Chen and Victor Casado
       
# Intentions:

A working RFC 6238-based one time password authentication server and client      
Presentation demo-ing our server, history of authentication of this type, and how our code works on a higher level   
    
# Intended usage:

Terminal-run program with likely extension into a web service.   
  
# Technical Details:

## Overview:
A service complying with [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238).

## Cyber topics covered:
- Hashing
- Secret Key Verification

## Responsibility Breakdown:

### Victor Casado:
- General authentication framework (avoiding hash function)
- Slidedecks: History, How it works
- Video presentation
  
### David Chen:
- HMAC-SHA Function
- Slidedecks: History, How it works
- Video presentation
- Video editing and submission  
    
# Intended pacing:

General Auth Framework using OpenSSL hash: May 21st
    
Custom HMAC-SHA function: May 23rd
   
SlideDecks: May 26th
   
Video Submission: May 28nd
